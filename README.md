jasmine looping an "it" calling a function that does expect -- it won't work
============================================================================

It won't work... and if you want to try, you can

  git clone https://github.com/jianlin/jasmine-looping-an-it-calling-function-that-does-expect.git

and then open the file SpecRunner.html in your browser with the developer tool open to look at the console.log
